  This is intended to address the files CovidDeaths(2).csv, Covidvaccinations(2).csv, and Tableau display.rb.
  Object of this endevour is to explore the rates of covid deaths and impact on the population at different times. Hopefully when i find a better way to import the data set to MYSQL is can explore it fully.
Step 1 pull covid data
Step 2 clean data and import into mysql
    Reduced the data set to only include 2 countries of my choosing, Italy and United as the data consisted of 237k rows and would take an estimated week to import. 
Step 3 Query and Analyze data
Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
